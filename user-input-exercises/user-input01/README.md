# Basic user input exercise

## Here are the steps used to complete the program:

- First we declare the variable for age input.
- Then we use the printf function to ask the user for the age.
- Then we use the scanf function that accepts user input. What we place inside our scanf function is the format specifier (%d for integer values) and then the variable name (age) preceded with a "&" (address of operator).
- We then use printf again to display the user's age.
